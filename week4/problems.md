# Week 4
## It's Esoteric Programming Languages time!
What's your favorite language? Java? Python? _Perl_ (ick)? One thing you'll learn in CS is that languages are just an means to an end and there is no "one best language for everything." So this week, let's tackle some simple problems in a different language.

"Esoteric Programming Languages" are languages to test the boundaries of possibility, to serve as "software art", or are simply a joke. They're often funny, rather silly, poorly structured, and probably documented horribly. At the same time, they're clever, unique, and are a blast to mess around with. This week, I encourage you to look up an esoteric language, download it, and try solving the challenges below using one. They're not particularly complex challenges, but they're not trivial either. Use this as an fun opportunity to get out of your comfort zone and try a new language.

Note: You don't have to use an _esoteric_ language. Just try using a language you've never used before!

### Recommended languages
1. LOLCODE
2. Arnold C
3. Shakespeare
4. Brainf ck
5. Anything you've never written before

### No One Man Should Have All That Power
Write a function that takes in an integer _n_ and returns _True_ if _n_ is a power of 2. Otherwise, return _False_.

### God I Really Hate Fibonocci Numbers
Write a function that takes in an integer _n_ and returns _True_ if _n_ is a number in the Fibonocci Sequence. Otherwise, return _False_.

### Challengier: Evaluate a Polynomial
Write a function that takes a vector of coefficients and a value, and evaluates the polynomial. For example,
```
  poly(4, {6, -3, -5, 2, 8})
  => 2090
  ```
Represents the polynomial 6 - 3x - 5x^2 + 2x^3 + 8x^4 evaluated at x = 4.


## Closing Notes
Using an esoteric language isn't required, but let's try and mix it up this week and use some more funky languages. There's more to the world than just Python, Dan.

# Ram Hacks's Weekly Programming Challenge Week 7!

## Esoteric... with a twist.
Remember how much fun the esoteric programming challenge was a few weeks ago? This week is the first in a two-part challenge where we... _drumroll_ write our own languages! Most everyone here has used a programming language before, but how many of us have written our own? This weeks challenge is to write a basic interpreter with the hopes of later being able to solve the problems from [Week 4](https://github.com/ram-hacks/Weekly-Programming-Challenge/tree/master/week4) again.

## How to write your own language
Writing your own language is not simple. Most of us probably haven't ever done it nor thought much about it. Writing a simple interpreter shouldn't be that scary, though. There are plenty of great resources on the web. Stick to a language you know (to write it in), don't make your instructions too silly, and remember, have fun! Bonus points for creativity.

Once your interpreter is written, try solving the problems using your own language again. Have fun!

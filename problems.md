Find the Missing Number
You are given an unsorted list of n-1 numbers in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates, and one number in the sequence is missing.

Write a method, in any language of your choosing, to find the missing number.

### Test Case
`[7,8,10,3,6,5,1,2,9]` should return or print 4

### Challenge
If you are looking for a little more of a challenge, try to solve this without sorting the list. Further, you can try to find the most
efficient solution, or use as few lines as possible (code golf).

Good luck!

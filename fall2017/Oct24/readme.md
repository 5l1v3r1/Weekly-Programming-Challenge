# Programming Challenge for October 24

Feel free to talk to other club members about these problems, and if you have any questions feel free to contact the club admins. If you need help using GitHub please talk to a club admin or consult the various online guide, such as this [article](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/).

As a breif guide, since this is a protected repository, you will need to create a *fork* of this reposisitory. Go [here](https://github.com/ram-hacks/Weekly-Programming-Challenge), and click *fork*, you will need to be logged on. Then go to your profile, you will see your fork of the Weekly-Programming-Challenges appear under your repositories. Click on it, and navigate to this week's submission folder. You can then upload files, and edit anything you need in the form of *commits*. Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can go back to the main page of your fork, https://github.com/\[**your username here!!!**\]/Weekly-Programming-Challenge, and click *New Pull Request*. Once you submit a pull request, one of the club admins will review your change and accept it.

## Novice Challenge

This week will be sorting! Sorting is a neat topic because there are SO MANY sorting algorithms to try out. The goal of your code will be to take in any amount of numbers, put them in an array or list, and sort them. It does not matter which sort you use, in fact it doesn't even have to be an established sorting algorithm, you can come up with your own way of doing it.

What do we mean by sorting? We want you to turn this:

>10 59 40 -5 40 3 0 46

Into this:

>-5 0 3 10 40 40 46 59

Some easier sorts to look at would be Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, or Bubble Sort.

Some fun sorts to look at would be Bogo Sort or Sleep Sort.

Some hard sorts to look at would be Bitwise-Radix Sort, or Parallel Merge Sort


## Advanced Challenge

Advanced Challenges will be a problem selected from Kattis. While it is not necessary to create an account, and test your solution with the autograder, it is recommended. You should still commit your solution to the github repository so we can pull it up easily during a club meeting, should you decide to talk about it. Feel free to post your code, even if you have not arrived at a solution.

[Eight Queens](https://open.kattis.com/problems/8queens)

This is a classic recursive backtracking problem, and there is plenty of literature about how to solve this problem. This question is a little different in that it asks you to check if a given solution is correct.

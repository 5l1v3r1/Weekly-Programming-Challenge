# Programming Challenge for {Unannounced}

Feel free to talk to other club members about these problems, and if you have any questions feel free to contact the club admins. If you need help using GitHub please talk to a club admin or consult the various online guide, such as this [article](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/).

As a breif guide, since this is a protected repository, you will need to create a *fork* of this reposisitory. Go [here](https://github.com/ram-hacks/Weekly-Programming-Challenge), and click *fork*, you will need to be logged on. Then go to your profile, you will see your fork of the Weekly-Programming-Challenges appear under your repositories. Click on it, and navigate to this week's submission folder. You can then upload files, and edit anything you need in the form of *commits*. Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can go back to the main page of your fork, github.com/\[**your username here!!!**\]/Weekly-Programming-Challenge, and click *New Pull Request*. Once you submit a pull request, one of the club admins will review your change and hopefully accept it.

## Esoteric

This is the final programming challenge. This problem will account for both the Advanced and Novice Challenge. How? Esoteric languages. An Esoteric language is described as "computer programming language designed to experiment with weird ideas, to be hard to program in, or as a joke, rather than for practical use."

There is a website dedicated to [these languages](https://www.esolangs.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Implemented&pageuntil=Deadfish+x#mw-pages). There are very many languages on that page. Feel free to choose any language you wish. Keep in mind the challenge for this week IS the language, not what you do with it. In some of these languages, "hello world!" is quite the challenge. So submit whatever you make with these languages.

You do NOT have to use an Esoteric language for this challenge. If you have always wanted to try another regular language, go for it. If you are unsure which language to use, I quite enjoyed working with [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC).

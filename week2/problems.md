# Week 2
This is week 2 of Ram Hack's weekly programming challenge.

### X is a Permutation of Y
_Source:_ This is an actual interview question from a Silicon Valley giant!

Given two strings, `a` and `b`, determine if one is a permutation of another.

*Example*:
    permutation('abc', 'bca') -> True
    permutation('abc', 'xyz') -> False

Keep efficiency in mind when solving this problem! Remember, your solution should be viable for strings of _any_ length, not just simple ones.


### Special Pythagorean Triplet
_Source_: This problem comes to us from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problem=9)

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numberse, `a < b < c` for which:
    ```a^2 + b^2 = c^2```.

For example:
    ```3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2``` or ```9 + 16 = 25```.

There exists exactly _one_ Pythagorean triplet for which `a + b + c = 1000`. Find the product of `abc`.


Again, these problems are just for fun. Hope everyone gives them a shot though!

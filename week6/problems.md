# Ram Hacks's Weekly Programming Challenge Week 6!

The goal with the following problem is to give our new programmers a chance at a more straightforward challenge, and for our more experienced programmers to have fun with esoteric languages (again)! With that said, please feel free to use whatever language you like! Have fun!

The following problem has been adapted from codechef.com.

## ATM
Toni would like withdraw money from the ATM to buy pizza for RAM Hacks this week! The ATM will only accept her transaction if the amount is a multiple of 5 (positive integers only), and if her account has enough money to perform the withdrawal (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal, the bank charges $0.50.
Your code should allow for a positive integer input amount (to be withdrew) from 0 < amt <= 2000. You should also allow for input of the current account balance, which is a nonnegative number from 0 <= bal <= 2000.    
Output the balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision.  If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.

## Sorting
This problem is aimed at more advanced programmers, but anyone can feel free to give it a shot!
Your task is to sort a list of integers. The integers will be be between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 (the typical range for integers), and your program should be able to handle large numbers of them (certainly more than 1,000, aim for 100,000). At next week's meeting, we will feed a very large dataset into everybody's entries, and whoever submitted the program that sorts them fastest will win the respect and adoration of all those in attendance. Also maybe a gift card or something, if Toni buys one.    
You can use any language, and any algorithm. If you're feeling ambitious, invent your own algorithm - or perhaps your own language!

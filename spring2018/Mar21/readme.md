# Programming Challenge for March 21

Feel free to talk to other club members about these problems, and if you have any questions feel free to contact the club admins. If you need help using GitHub please talk to a club admin or consult the various online guide, such as this [article](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/).

You could also check out [our guide](../../submission-guide/readme.md) on how to make submissions.

## Novice Challenge

This week will be sorting! Sorting is a neat topic because there are SO MANY sorting algorithms to try out. The goal of your code will be to take in any amount of numbers, put them in an array or list, and sort them. It does not matter which sort you use, in fact it doesn't even have to be an established sorting algorithm, you can come up with your own way of doing it.

What do we mean by sorting? We want you to turn this:

>10 59 40 -5 40 3 0 46

Into this:

>-5 0 3 10 40 40 46 59

You control how to do input and output to your program. You could embed it in your solution, ask the user for input, or read from a file.

Some easier sorts to look at would be Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, or Bubble Sort. Some fun sorts to look at would be Bogo Sort or Sleep Sort. Some hard sorts to look at would be Bitwise-Radix Sort, or Parallel Merge Sort


## Advanced Challenge

Advanced Challenges will be a problem selected from Kattis. While it is not necessary to create an account, and test your solution with the autograder, it is recommended. You should still commit your solution to the github repository so we can pull it up easily during a club meeting, should you decide to talk about it. Feel free to post your code, even if you have not arrived at a solution.

[Eight Queens](https://open.kattis.com/problems/8queens)

This is a classic recursive backtracking problem, and there is plenty of literature about how to solve this problem. This question is a little different from the normal one that it asks you to check if a given solution is correct.
